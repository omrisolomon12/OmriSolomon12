### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**omrisolomon12/OmriSolomon12** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on detect and classify objects in Cognata simulation videos and get a mAP calculation using the ground truth data and the detection data.

Hey. 
Real-Time Object detection (YOLOv5) on Cognata simulation videos. Extracting the ground truth data from Cognata simulator. Extracting the detection results. Calculating mean Average Precision using the detection results and the ground truth data.
Trained the network on simulation data of traffic lights and did the detection ( on the weights of the simulation traning ) and secceded to detect real trafic lights.
Showed we can train on simulation data and can detect real life objects.

Please open the Conclusions explained.pptx for more details
