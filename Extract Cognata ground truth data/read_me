i represent a way to extract and convert the grund truth data from Cognata simulations to a text file, In a format that can be use in Cartucho mAP calculator .
this text file contains the ground truth data (in pixels level) of evey object in each frame (can see an example in frame 1.txt)
The ground truth data that Cognata offering is a csv file for every frame in the simulation video (can see an example in 0000000033.csv)  
The ChangeNameExel.ipynb file convert all the csv files names to a hierarchical names such as frame 1 , frame 2 ....
The ExelToText.ipynb extrat the 2D data and the class name of all the objects from each csv file into a text file (can see an example in frame 1.txt) 
This text file is written in a format that can be use as an input ground truth in Cartucho mAP calculator (github.com/Cartucho/mAP)

after operating a detection system (OD.py) we get a text file for each frame that contains the detected objects ( in a format that can be use as an input "detection results" in  Cartucho mAP calculator).

The ExToText is fo the training!. this file extract the ground truth data from cognata to a text file and convert the coordinates from {(x1,y1) top left cornet, (x2,y2) bottom right corner} 
to the following { (x1,x2) the  middle of the object , (w,h) Width and height of the object}
this is replacing the labling stage!
